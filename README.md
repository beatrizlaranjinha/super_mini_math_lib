# zk-guillou-quisquater (Rust)

A very small experimental cryptography library written in Rust.

This project explores fundamental number-theory operations and provides a toy implementation of the **Guillou–Quisquater (GQ)** zero-knowledge identification protocol.

It was built for learning purposes and because my professor told me to!

## Learning Context

This project was created as part of studying:

- Modular arithmetic
- Zero-knowledge identification protocols
- Public-key cryptography foundations
- Rust systems-level programming
